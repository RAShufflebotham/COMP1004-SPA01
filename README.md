Robin Ashley Shufflebotham - COMP1004 Security Dashboard

Project Title
Creation of Security Dashboard which provides information on the security status of a network and its systems

Project Vision
My product called the “SecurityDashboard” is an elegant, yet simple Security Dashboard designed to allow for network/system administrators to manage the security status of their network or system, in the most effective and efficient means possible. My product will provide clear and easily accessible information on various key aspects on a network/system. These include: security alerts, current vulnerabilities, risks, log activity, reports, operations, network/system activity, offenses, user analytics and more general network and system log statuses. This product will therefore solve the arduous task of trying to locate and monitor multiple areas of a network/system and allow for its management to be done easier and more effectively. Unlike other systems available on the market, my product offers a far more user-friendly experience with its clear and easy to use display and controls, which will also be available at a far more affordable price.
